                    The building block of Orcinus-generated games is object. Object could range from game assets to variables. These can be used to modify the appearance of the game and how the game is played. In general, here are types of objects that you can use in this language.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Variables</h3>
                    <p>In general Orcinus variables can be classified into 2 groups, numeric and string</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Orcinus uses type inference, meaning that on declaration the type of the variable need not to be explicitly declared before the variable name. As a comparison, let's put the code of Java and Orcinus side by side to see the difference.</p>

                Orcinus is a language to create and play maze based games, aimed to teach people how to code. The syntax is mostly inspired by Ruby and Python, the code is interpreted and read line by line, and built upon JavaScript. The language also uses type inferences, meaning that the type of the variable need not to be explicitly declared before the variable name. The language is, however, strongly typed in a sense that there is a restriction when two values of different types are intermingled.
